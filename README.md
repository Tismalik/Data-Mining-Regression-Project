# Data-Mining-Regression-Project
<h3> This is a project that applies a Supervised Regression model to predict the time taken for an aircraft to complete a taxi maneuver </h3> 
<b>Taxitime</b> is the time it takes for planes to organizes or moves on the ground between the terminal building  and the run way.
<li>The idea is that the runway times are fixed so for "Departures" predict the latest time to push back from the gate so that we donâ€™t need to que at the runway.</li>
<li> Instead making the aircraft queue at the gate with the  engine switched off</li>
<li> For "Arrivals", we want to predict the arrival time at the gate so we properly prepare it to receive passengers</li>
  
<h3> Possible Application/Deployment Area: </h3>
Predictions could also be used by an automate rooting system that finds the route through the taxiways that takes the shortest time, the least few or is the most unlikely to be disrupted.
